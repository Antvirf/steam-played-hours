# steam-played-hours

Python 3.5
20th March 2017
Inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/60bqxi/graph_of_hours_spent_playing_video_games_on_steam/

This script was written to collect hours played data for all games of a person's steam.
Requires request, json, bs4 modules to work, with matplotlib as well as numpy used for plotting if desired.

Zero guarantee it works on your machine. Runs fine on a mac. May encounter encoding errors.
